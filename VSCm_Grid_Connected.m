%% Parameters for Three-Phase Grid-Tied Inverter Example
%
% This example shows how to control the voltage in a grid-tied inverter 
% system. The Voltage regulator subsystem implements the PI-based control 
% strategy. The three-phase inverter is connected to the grid via a 
% Circuit Breaker. The Circuit Breaker is open at the beginning of the 
% simulation to allow synchronization. At time 0.15 seconds, the Circuit 
% breaker closes, and the inverter is connected to the grid. The Scopes 
% subsystem contains scopes that allow you to see the simulation results. 
% The inverter is implemented using IGBTs. To speed up simulation, or for 
% real-time deployment, the IGBTs can be replaced with Averaged Switches. 
% In this way the gate signals can be averaged over a specified period or 
% replaced with modulation waveforms.
